Extract all files in the same directory.
To compile (Windows/Linux)
 javac PacketDriverExample.java
To run example in Windows:
 java PacketDriverExample
To run example in Linux:
 java -Djava.library.path=. PacketDriverExample

Notes:
1.- This version should work both in 32 and 64 bit environments. SimplePacketDriver.class will try to load the 32-bit version first and if an error is reported, will load the 64-bit version instead.
2.- Make sure you are admin/root or you will not be able to open the adapter in promiscuous mode.


Files:

/doc - javadoc files documenting the driver
libsimplepacketdriver.so, libsimplepacketdriver_x64.so - Library with native hooks for Linux
simplepacketdriver.dll, simplepacketdriver_x64.dll - DLLs with native hooks for Windows
SimplePacketDriver.class - Open adapters, capture and send
SimplePacketDriver.jar - A jar with the previous class (so it's easier to import the class in some Java IDEs).
PacketDriverExample.java - Sample code using the driver
PacketDriverExample.class - Bytecode corresponding to previous file
PacketSnifferExample.java - A very simple Java-based packet sniffer
packetdriverexample.pcap - Wireshark capturing traffic generated by sample program
telnet.dat - Sample file showing packet format for the projects


# Mac OSX

The wrapper requires libnet and libpcap to be installed in OSX. libpcap comes installed with Xcode, so only libnet needs to be retrieved. There are two methods:

  1. Install with homebrew
  2. Compile from source (with patches)

## Homebrew

If homebrew is installed, execute

    brew install libnet

More information about homebrew can be found at: http://brew.sh

## Source

The latest libnet source code can be found at https://github.com/sam-github/libnet

Execute the following on the command line

    wget 'http://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/libnet-dev/libnet-1.1.6.tar.gz'
    tar xfvz libnet-1.1.6.tar.gz
    cd libnet-1.1.6
    ./configure && make && sudo make install
